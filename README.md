# Welcome to Enkryptor

Let's get you secure.

## Pre-requisites

First you will need a Java runtime environment if you do not have one already. Check out <https://www.java.com/en/>.

For development you will also need a JDK, or Java Development Kit. The most recent JDK can be found here: <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html>

## Application Download

To run the application you can either look for the .jar file to download and run. This is all you will need to run the application. (Not currently available. You will need to build from source.)

If that is not available you can build from source. Download this repository from the download button above. You can then open this in an IDE and run Main.java. Your IDE should be able to build this provided that you have a JDK and a JRE.

If you don't want to use an IDE you can build the project using

```
javac Main.java
```

Then run the program with

```
java Main.java
```
